💰 FundFlow: The Next-Gen Gamified FinTech Prototype
Project Type: High-Fidelity Frontend Prototype (Built for rapid visualization and design execution)

LIVE DEMO 🔗https://genzfundflow.netlify.app/

FundFlow is a Gen Z-focused financial dashboard with a sleek cyber-punk Tron aesthetic. Designed as a high-fidelity prototype, it helps users visualize earnings, track expenses, set savings goals, and make smarter budgeting decisions—all wrapped in a striking neon-glow interface.

🌟 Key Features & Design Highlights
🚀 Cinematic UI: Achieves a highly distinct, professional aesthetic using a neon-glow cyber-punk theme for maximum visual engagement.

💳 Dynamic Tracking: Features an expense tracker with dynamic categorization and a smart budget allocation tool.

🏆 Gamified Finance: Includes high-fidelity placeholders for advanced features like Achievement badges, financial advice, Challenges, Quizzes, and a Mood Coach.

🌐 Modern Stack: Built on React (Vite-based) and styled using Tailwind CSS for component-based efficiency and rapid development.

🧰 Tech Stack
Frontend Framework: React (Vite-based)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Focus on utility-first styling)

Language: JavaScript

Deployment: Netlify

💡 Developer Notes & Future Vision
FundFlow was executed in a limited timeframe (hackathon context), demonstrating the ability to deliver complex, high-fidelity designs under pressure. The current setup uses internal mock data, confirming that all features (charts, trackers, goals) are fully functional on the frontend.

Key Learning: Achieving the unique, immersive aesthetic required deep mastery of complex CSS styling and advanced Tailwind CSS customization.

Future Integration: This architecture is perfectly staged for a full-stack implementation, where the mock data would be replaced by a secure Google Cloud Run backend service for user authentication and persistent transaction storage.
